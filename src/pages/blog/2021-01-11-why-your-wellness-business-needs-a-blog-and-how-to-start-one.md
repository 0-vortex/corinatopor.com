Some business owners think of blogging as something only “bloggers” do to share their personal stories. However, blogging is actually a powerful marketing tool—and it’s one of our top recommendations for new businesses to grow your health coaching audience and brand!

**should your website have a blog?**

We think so!

We recommend all (well, okay, most) websites include a blog.

Your blog can be structured in many different ways, contain different types of content, be comprised of different mediums (like writing, videos or photos), be written by one author or multiple authors. There are a gazillion different ways to set up and maintain your blog, and different strategies will work best for different business types and industries.

But a common thread among most websites is that having a blog will help to grow both your website audience and your business overall.

Here are a few key reasons maintaining a blog can support your broader goals for your wellness business:

## WHY BLOGGING IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS:

### blogging improves your website’s seo

It’s true. Most websites’ SEO (search engine optimization—the ability of search engines to see and rank your content) is dramatically enhanced by including a quality blog. There are a few ways maintaining a blog works to boost your entire website’s SEO:

- Each new blog post adds more content, titles and keywords to your website that search engines can then crawl to determine what your site is about. For new websites in particular, this means a blog can help search engines better “see” you, as well as better understand the content you provide and who they should send your way.
- Because blog posts are able to explore content in more depth and specificity than general pages or product descriptions typically do, they can better position your content to be relevant to specific questions your audience is searching for.
- Blog posts are typically published more frequently than other pages on your site are updated. This regular activity helps to show search engines that your site is updated regularly and contains current information.
- Blog posts are organized with categories and tags, both types of metadata that help to communicate your keywords to search engines.
- An archive of quality blog posts can keep visitors on your site, exploring your content for longer. This helps SEO because increased “dwell time” shows search engines that visitors find your content useful.
- Blog posts tend to be better at incorporating long-tail keywords than other types of pages on your site. Long-tail keywords (more than four words) are an important part of your SEO strategy, as they tend to be more specifically relevant to what your audience is searching. (For example, you may think of “vegetarian” as a keyword, but “healthy vegetarian meal ideas” is a long-tail keyword that’s more likely to appear in real life searches.)
- Blog content gives you more opportunities for internal linking throughout your site. For example, here’s another blog post we wrote on why internal linking helps boost your website’s SEO.
- In addition to promoting internal linking, blog posts provide more opportunities for other sites to link back to your site, promoting inbound links as well.
- Squarespace’s blogging interface allows you to set a location to each blog post, an important SEO element if you offer in-person location-based services.

The SEO benefits tend to be enough of a reason to start blogging to grow your website, but there are other important benefits a blog brings to your business as well:

### sharing expertise establishes you as an expert

Particularly for new health coaches, publishing blog posts related to topics you have particular expertise in helps to establish you as an industry expert—and, thus, a brand that customers respect and trust.

Aim to specifically share content that your target audience would find useful, and that’s relevant to the services or products your business offers (whether that’s 1:1 services, online membership programs, etc.).

### blogging helps to define your brand

Blogging is a simple and effective way to establish a voice for your brand. 

Whether you’re a formal practitioner with science-based evidence; a relatable coach offering supportive advice; or you communicate complicated topics with a sense of humor—a blog is your opportunity to define your voice and your brand. 

Your blog posts help to establish who you are as a health coach, building rapport and helping your audience (potential customers!) better understand and connect with you. 

### content marketing grows your audience

Blog content provides an opportunity to promote your expertise (and business!) via content marketing. And content marketing just so happens to be one of our very favorite methods of growing your audience and business.

In particular, we recommend sharing your blog content on Pinterest (which technically isn’t social media 😉), and even guest posting on relevant sites. 

Blogging + Pinterest is a great, cost-effective way to promote your business to new audiences.

## HOW TO START A BLOG ON YOUR SQUARESPACE WEBSITE

If you’re sold by blogging’s benefits and would like to start a blog to support your business goals, it’s simple! Personally, we use and recommend Squarespace—our favorite website platform for health coaches and wellness professionals.

Here are four easy steps to start a blog on your Squarespace website:

### 1. create your blog

In your left-hand pages navigation bar, click the + and select Blog. 

(You can keep your new blog disabled or in your unlinked pages section until your content is ready.)

### 2. style your blog

Design your blog experience with your readers in mind. This may mean removing or adding certain information that comes standard on Squarespace blogs. Some examples may be adjusting blog post metadata, customizing the blog post URL format, or removing social share counts.

You don’t even have to call your blog “Blog”—feel free to name it anything that makes sense for your business. Some examples: “Resources,” “Learn,” etc.

You’ll also want to think about how you want your blog posts to display: they can be arranged in a simple list, display their thumbnail images, etc.

All Squarespace templates have some ability to customize blog style in the site style editor (Design > Site Styles). Other changes can always be customized with custom code (which Five Design Co. helps with if needed).

We recommend setting up a blog post template that you’ll work off of to create new posts. This eliminates the need to add more complicated elements (like related post reels or newsletter opt-ins) manually each time you create a new post.

### 3. add blog posts

Now you’ll create and publish your first blog posts! 

Your blog posts can take many forms, or some combination of these forms:

- Formal written articles
- Conversational stories
- Videos
- Photos
- Tutorials
- Anything else that’s relevant to your business!

Regardless of your topic area or how you choose to present your content, here are our recommendations for how to write a good blog post. 

To create a new blog post: navigate to the back end of your Blog and click the +  to add a new post.

### 4. promote your blog posts to grow your audience

Once you publish your blog posts, they’ll already be working for you and your business behind the scenes, contributing to SEO and giving visitors more content to get you know and trust your brand. 

But you can further maximize the impact of your blog posts by using them to promote your website (and thus business!) to new audiences. Here’s more about our favorite content marketing strategy to grow your website traffic on autopilot.

## BLOGGING FAQS

**What should I write about?**

Anything you have expertise on and that your target audience would find useful, educational or entertaining!

**How long should my blog posts be?**

Best practice (for SEO purposes) is to aim for around 1,200 words +.

**What’s your favorite platform for blogging?**

[Squarespace](https://squarespace.syuh.net/Lk4Pj)!

**How many blog posts should I have to start?**

We recommend starting with a set of blog posts that can collectively give a pretty comprehensive overview of your business. If you’re more of a general health coach, that could be a post in each of the category areas you work in. Or, if you specialize in a particular area of health (for example, women’s health), you could include a set of posts demonstrating that’s your primary focus.

It’s also nice for your readers to have access to other blog posts they may find interesting after reading one. (How often have you read a blog post you loved and not clicked through to read more content from the same author?)

**How frequently should I post on my blog?**

The magic number varies based on your business type and size—and, quite frankly, your capacity to create and publish quality content. Some large sites do well posting several times a day, and many smaller sites post weekly. 

We recommend starting with a weekly or bi-weekly post and adjusting from there based on what works best for you.

For planning purposes, here’s the exact blog content calendar template we use for our own blogs.
